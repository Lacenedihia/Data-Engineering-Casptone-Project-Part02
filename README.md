# Data-Engineering-Casptone-Project-Part02 - Data Quality, Orchestration and Visualization
In Part 2 of the capstone project,I have  enhanced the data pipeline you built in part 1 by integrating data quality checks, orchestration, and data visualization to create a more robust architecture. 
This includes developing analytical views to showcase insights generated by the pipeline.
In the process, I have refine my skills by practicing with key Data Engineering tools.
